# To do

* Features
    * Add more built-in functions, like `echo` etc
    * Allow responding to non-targetted messages, e.g. `Jesus Christ` -> `Yes, my son?`
    * Allow responding with emoji responses
    * Allow user-defined Python functions
    * Allow reloading bot config via chat. It should tell you if something changed or not when you do this.
    * Define users who should be able to run any command in the config. Then you don't have to define any access controls but still your own account can run all commands.
* Docs
    * Some of the old scripts were just docs placeholders for the user to write a real implementation, e.g. `backup.sh`; write docs instead?
    * Publish somewhere like readthedocs or github pages?
* Publish to pypi
* Offer PRs for anything the eno project is interested in?
