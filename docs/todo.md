# To do

* Features
    * Add more built-in functions, like `echo` etc
    * Allow responding to non-targetted messages, e.g. `Jesus Christ` -> `Yes, my son?`
    * Allow responding with emoji responses
    * Allow user-defined Python functions
    * Define users who should be able to run any command in the config. Then you don't have to define any access controls but still your own account can run all commands.
    * Hot-reload when the bot files or configuration change on disk, maybe using pyinotify
    * Log some events to a specified channel. Thinking especially for automatic hot reloads.
* Docs
    * Some of the old scripts were just docs placeholders for the user to write a real implementation, e.g. `backup.sh`; write docs instead?
    * Publish somewhere like readthedocs or github pages?
* Publish to pypi
* Offer PRs for anything the eno project is interested in?
